# Fetch-Test-Project
This app is written in SwiftUI, using Combine for networking tasks.  Packages include SwiftyJSON for some of the json unpacking, and Kingfisher for async image caching.  Unit tests are included and are ready to run.  File structure is organized into Core (custom views, extensions, networking classes, models and resourse), App (app/app delegate files), and Module (screens) folders.

The project is ready to build and run currently on download.  Code was mainly ran and tested on an iPhone 14 pro, as that's just what I own, but also on a variety of simulators.  Unit tests are included under the Fetch Test ProjectTests folder, organized into Modules and Core folders as well.
